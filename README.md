Using Normal Equation to find theta values of a linear model to find pattern between BODY WEIGHT and Brain WEIGHT of Mammals.
X: Feature matrix
Y: Label/Output matrix
@: theta
T: Transpose

Normal Equation:

@ = ((X^T)*X)^-1)*((X^T)*Y)

Hypothesis: h(@) = @0 + @1*x1


CONCLUSION:
The values of theta generated provides a reasonable prediction using the hypothesis.
